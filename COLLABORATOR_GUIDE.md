## Development Hints

`npm link` is very similar to `npm install -g` except that instead of downloading the package from the repo

```
npm link
```

Any changes to the files in the `cli/` folder will immediately affect the global `@ptsecurity/cli` package,
allowing you to quickly test any changes you make to the cli project.
